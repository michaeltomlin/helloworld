OUR RESULTS  
###[Read Our User Guide](TrinityTG-Prototype-User Guide-Thunderstruck .pdf). ###Run the Prototype (codename Thunderstruck). This application allows California residents to receive emergency and non-emergency emails and SMS notifications from several identified sources. This application is geo-location aware, provides administrators to ability publish, track, analyze, and visualize related data. Full Requirements #OUR PROJECT APPROACH ###The project approach was driven by a very compressed schedule with two distinct tracks of requirements
####1. Responding to the Response for Inquiry (RFI) Requirement's administrative/Submission requirements
####2. Building working open-source software using an Agile/iterative approach based on the Digital Services Playbook. ##Responding to the RFI ####Using TrinityTG's proven approach, the team managed the RFI response by tracking the state procurement site and monitoring the procurement GitHub site while breaking down the RFI so we could build-up our response. As our proposal team focused on the RFI response, our Director of Business Development led the resolution of requirement #2 as the Product Manager (play 6). Responding to the RFI is not documented beyond this brief description.
##Building Working Software ####We also turned to our proven approach to manage the software build. This included assembling our highly-qualified team and building our project playbook. Our Enterprise Agile Coach worked with the Product Manager (aka Product Owner) and the Delivery Manager (aka Scrum Master) to layout an Agile based project playbook that included a dedicated working area in our Sacramento office for the team to co-locate and collaborate. This playbook resulted in the software build described in our technical approach below. In this project approach section, we focus on the details that do not clearly fit within the "a. through t." punch list below.
